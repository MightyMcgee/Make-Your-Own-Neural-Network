## Objective

1. Use the MNIST dataset to practice training and testing your dataset.
2. Use your own data to test your own neural network or retrain it for a new task.
3. Analyze how changes to the parameters effect your neural network. 

## Part 1: MNIST Dataset

1. Follow these instructions to train your neural network on a subset of the MNIST dataset of handwritten numbers. 
2. **Train and test your dataset with both the subset and the full MNIST dataset**
3. Once you get the hang of how to train and test your dataset, you can move on to part 2. 

## Part 2: Improving Your Network or Creating Your Own

1. For this section, you can either continue to explore the network you just trained using your own handwriting. Or, you can 
2. 
You can use the following and use your own handwriting
Run your train on groups of two sizes

## Deliverables

For this lab, submit the following deliverables: 
1. A Jupyter Notebook with your neural network and accuracy calculations
2. Project uploaded to GitHub
3. Social impact reflection

## Social Impact Reflection

Using your two articles about the environmental impacts of AI as additional sources. Answer the following questions in at least 250 words each: 
1. Who is responsible for mitigating the environmental impact of AIâ€”developers, governments, or users? Why?
2. Should companies prioritize environmental sustainability over the rapid development of AI? How might that change the industry?
