## Objective

1. Use the MNIST dataset to practice training and testing your dataset.
2. Use your own data to test your own neural network or retrain it for a new task.
3. Analyze how changes to the parameters effect your neural network. 

## Part 1: MNIST Dataset

1. Follow these instructions to train your neural network on a subset of the MNIST dataset of handwritten numbers. 
2. **Train and test your dataset with both the subset and the full MNIST dataset**. 
3. Once you get the hang of how to train and test your dataset, you can move on to part 2. 

*See Part1.pdf*

## Part 2: Improving Your Network or Creating Your Own

1. For this section, you can either continue to explore the network you just trained using your own handwriting. Or, you can create a dataset of your own handwriting and continue to refine your model.
2. Either way, try running your model with datasets of multiple sizes to compare their accuracy.
3. You will need to submit a Jupyter notebook that clearly explains your project to a novice reader. 

*For using your own handwriting see Part2.pdf*

## Deliverables

For this lab, submit the following deliverables: 
1. A Jupyter Notebook with your neural network and accuracy calculations
2. Project uploaded to GitHub
3. Social impact reflection

Use professional spelling/grammar and a neutral, objective voice when writing your documentation. 

*See sample_notebook.ipynb as an example*

## Social Impact Reflection

Using your two articles about the environmental impacts of AI as additional sources. Answer the following questions in at least 250 words each: 
1. Who is responsible for mitigating the environmental impact of AIâ€”developers, governments, or users? Why?
2. Should companies prioritize environmental sustainability over the rapid development of AI? How might that change the industry?

## Rubric

12 points - Project contains all required components and uses professional language
10 points - Project is complete but writing components are not professional(either the notebook or the social impact reflection.) 
8 points - Program is functional and includes only one of the social impact reflection or Jupyter notebook explanations. 
6 points -  Program is functional but includes neither an explanatory Jupyter notebook nor a social impact reflection.
